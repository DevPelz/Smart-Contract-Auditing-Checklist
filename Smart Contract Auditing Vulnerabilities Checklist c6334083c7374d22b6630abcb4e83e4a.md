| Block stuffing | Medium | Deliberate insertion of unnecessary operations to increase block size. |
| Metamorphic contracts (bytecode mutation) | High | Smart contracts that can change their bytecode, making analysis challenging. |

| Short address attacks (Solidity <0.5.0) | Medium | Exploiting the lack of input validation in early Solidity versions. |
| Token approval griefing | Medium | Exploiting vulnerabilities in token approval mechanisms. |
| Force-feeding attacks | High | Manipulating contract state through forced transactions. |
| Weak on-chain randomness  | High | Exploitable randomness generation in smart contracts. |
| Unbounded gas consumption by returning a lot of data | High | Consuming excessive gas by returning large data sets. |
| Default enum values | Medium | Security risks associated with default enum values. |
| Storage collisions with delegate call | High | Unintended data corruption due to storage collisions. |
| Function selector collisions (zero selectors) | Medium | Collisions in function selectors leading to unexpected behavior. |
| Hash collisions with dynamic types (packed ABI encoding | High | Vulnerabilities arising from hash collisions in dynamic types. |
| Vulnerable Rebalancing/Buyback Mechanics | High | Risks associated with flawed token rebalancing/buyback strategies. |
| Problems with ERC20 decimals | Medium | Security issues related to ERC20 token decimals. |

| Duplicate array elements | Medium | Risks associated with arrays containing duplicate elements. |
| Unlimited Token allowance | Medium | Risks arising from unlimited token allowances. |
| Misinitialization of contracts (ownership/proxy) | High | Security risks due to incorrect contract initialization. |
| Asserting contract from Code Size | Medium | Vulnerabilities related to assertions based on code size. |
| Unsafe Typecast | High | Risks associated with unsafe typecasting in smart contracts. |

| Dirty High Order Bits | Medium | Risks associated with manipulation of high-order bits. |
| Transaction order manipulation | High | Exploiting vulnerabilities in the order of transaction execution. |
| Uninitialized Proxies | High | Security issues related to uninitialized proxy contracts. |
| Reinitialization Vulnerability | High/Medium | Risks associated with contract reinitialization. |
| Flawed Math- Transaction Replay Attack | High | Risks related to flawed mathematical operations leading to replay attacks. |
| Incorrect Special Character Handling | Medium | Security vulnerabilities due to mishandling of special characters. |
| Governance Takeovers | High | Risks associated with potential takeover of governance mechanisms. |

### Additional Checks

- Check for Business Logic Vulnerabilities
- Check for correct inheritance
- Check if the spot price from an `AMM` as an oracle is used
- Check for tokens that use too many or too few decimals
- Check if internal accounting is mixed with actual balances
- Check if the Contract approves tokens before `transferFrom` to avoid revert
- Check if state variable layout is followed when using delegate-call in proxy contracts
- Check if events are emitted on critical functions
